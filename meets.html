                <td><p>The Skyline boys cross country team had the unique privilege of running before most people even had their first sip of coffee at the Jackson Invitational. Let’s be honest, the early morning start was a challenge in itself—those bleary-eyed athletes were up and running before the sun had properly woken up. But once the gun went off, the team showed that Skyline doesn’t just wake up; they show up!</p><p>Despite the pre-dawn timing, the boys battled through the cool morning mist and still managed to snag 19th place out of 31 teams. Sure, the Highland-Milford kids were practically sprinting to breakfast with their first-place times, but Skyline held their own with some strong performances.</p><p>Leading the charge for Skyline was <span class="athlete">Bruno Cifaldi</span>, who zoomed across the finish line in <time>16:41.60</time>, faster than most of us could run to grab our morning coffee. Close behind, <span class="athlete">Kyle Krasan</span> wasn’t about to let Bruno have all the glory, finishing with a time of <time>16:55.97</time>—proving he can clock in under 17 minutes just in time to still feel sleepy.</p><p>Next up was <span class="athlete">Matthew Guikema</span>, crossing the line in <time>17:01.11</time> and no doubt thinking about the breakfast that awaited him. <span class="athlete">Oskar MacArthur</span>, one of Skyline’s younger speedsters, raced in with a time of <time>17:11.69</time>, followed closely by <span class="athlete">Enshu Kuan</span> at <time>17:12.62</time>. <span class="athlete">Jack Robichaud</span> came in just a bit after them at <time>17:14.63</time>, rounding out a solid pack of Skyline runners.</p><p>And let’s not forget <span class="athlete">Martin Gehrke</span>, who finished his morning jog in <time>17:28.69</time>—just fast enough to beat the early-bird special. <span class="athlete">Dylan Hanley</span>, determined to keep pace, came in at <time>17:55.80</time>, wrapping up a well-fought race for the Skyline crew.</p></td>
